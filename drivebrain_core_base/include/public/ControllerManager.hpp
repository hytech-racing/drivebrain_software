// will be based on: https://github.com/hytech-racing/MCU/blob/adc599c9a2a3d1afe4ee22fcad0fd1116c474500/lib/systems/include/TorqueControllerMux.h

// TODO look into sharing tc mux between MCU and drivebrain software

// requirements:
// - shall handle ability to be constructed to contain the controllers,
//   handle providing them the inputs from state estimation and / or drivers

// - controller manager shall not affect the output of any controller.

// - each controller shall be able to handle re-configuration at runtime,
//   even while being the "active" controller, however the controller manager
//   shall handle when its configuration gets updated

// - vehicle manager shall handle stepping of each controller at their
//   desired rates and be able to switch between

// - vehicle manager shall be able to change the mode of the drivetrain dependent
//   on what mode the desired controller wants the drivetrain to be in (speed / torque)

// TODOs:
// - [ ] implement handling for switching between controllers -> yoink logic from new tcmux
// - [ ] implement function to pass in vehicle state to the active controller

// What I want to be able to do with the vehicle manager is be general about what controllers we are swapping between and evaluating during runtime.
// each controller (for now) will be stack allocated, however they wont always be running at the same time. We also want the ability to pause
// evaluation of all controllers, but this isnt something that we have to have at the start.

// We also want to be able to expose an interface to the user to use GRPC to interact with this
// vehicle manager to allow for control pieces of our car, like say run specific routines like
// start, stop lap time recording or set start location of lap timing. This, however, probably
// wouldnt be a part of the vehicle manager itself.

// For the sake of the controllers, I want to have a direct connection between the state estimator and the Controller Manager
// The controller manager will sample the state estimator (there will be a single state that the state estimator updates internally).
// on a side note, we need to make sure that we copy over the vehicle state here after locking onto the mutex and then unlock
// on a side note, how are we going to prevent mutex deadlocking on the shared state?
// we will do this by having the state estimator and the controller ticking in the same loop so no need for worrying about threading
